Philosophy in my work , is that I keep everything simple with no trace of myself. That every place I get in feel like home. Same time being only guest everywhere.

That means everything in life needed is installed with standard personally un-personal scripts that in case I leave them don't give lot of info about me. And I try to see only parts needed , open and close stuff quick

What does it do. **Master Branch is for server enviroment 'dev-default-rsync-folder' formally is for Desktop enviroment**

system_prepare.sh is the first thing , when all is installed : it must make main enviroment details for user. Preparing Blade. 

portable.sh : install /opt/portable with all moving parts (alias)

Все! Начинаю новую жизнь!

...Ну не такую уж и новую,
и не то что бы начинаю,
и не совсем жизнь...
